                        Now that “<span class="font-bold font-italic">who the fuck is me?</span>” Is off the table, a pretty much an intuitive and a by convention question is to be asked. “<span class="font-bold font-italic">What the fuck is this site for?</span>”

                        Long answer short, “<span class="font-bold font-italic">In pursuit of the pursuit</span>” is the simplest way to put it. It’s dedicated for it. Built on top of it. And, marches towards it. It sounds like it’s a high level low fidelity information. Well, yes it sounds so. Because it is. However, as time goes by things change, not only things, people too. Yet, as many whirling changes are out there, subtle stillness in other things does co-exist. Concepts are one of these things…

                        One engrossing concept that’s been well stated is “<span class="font-bold font-italic">Your values and decency are present yet shocked at your associations, appalled at your dreams. No forts in the bone arena of your skull for things you love.</span>” Undeniably engrossing! Right? It’s like no matter for how long nor how much effort you put in to push and resist, the things you love prevail and who you become is the sum of the multiple skirmishes inside your mind.
